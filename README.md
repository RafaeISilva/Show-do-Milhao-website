# notes
- this was originally an [app](https://github.com/ravsil/Show-do-Milhao-app) I made for a school event, days before it, it was converted into a website for convenience purposes (which ended up being the best thing to do).
- Pretty much the only thing kept from the original repository this was forked from were the css and html files. This was due to me being short on time, otherwise everything would've been made from 0
- Fun fact: all the questions were created by chatGPT (questions from the school version were too specific).
